    <p>Recipe source: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/57354/beef-pho/">Allrecipes</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds beef soup bones</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
      <li>1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 pounds beef oxtail</li>
      <li>1 white daikon radish, sliced</li>
      <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
      <li>1/2 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>2 whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds dried flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>1/2 pound frozen beef sirloin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place beef bones in 9-quart (or larger) pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Place onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined, 10x15-inch roasting pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Chop onions. Peel and slice ginger.</li>
      <li>Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions. Tie anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns, and charrged ginger in a square of cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 tsp of salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain broth. Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from bones for other uses if desired. Taste broth and add salt as needed. Chill overnight.</li>
      <li>Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
      <li>Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
      <li>Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling broth into bowls to cook beef and cover noodles.</li>
    </ol>
