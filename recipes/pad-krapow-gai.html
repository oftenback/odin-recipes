    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
      <li>Heat skillet over high heat. Add oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Cook on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in bottom of pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
